Colour codes: K(*)  This is also used for the highlight colour setting
Zero or more instances of:
    [OP]COLOUR

Where COLOUR is one of the following:
    NAME            A named colour known to wxWidgets (eg: red, blue, turquoise)
    #RRGGBB         A HTML-style hex colour
    RGB(r, g, b)    A CSS-style 3-part decimal colour

Where OP is one of the following:
    [NONE]          Set the colour to the given value
    =               Set the colour to the given value
    +               Add the given value to the current colour
    -               Subtract the given value from the current colour
    ~               Set the colour to the given value minus the current colour
    |               Binary OR the current colour with the given value
    &               Binary AND the current colour with the given value

If after any operation, one or more colour components lie outside the valid range (0-255) the colour is normalised as follows:
If a colour component is negative, shift up all the colour components equally such that the negative component is now zero.
If a colour component is over 255, scale all the colour components proportionally, such that the highest component is now 255.
