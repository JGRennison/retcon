Conditionals:

if <condition>                Executes the contents of the block if <condition> is met

else if <condition>           Executes the contents of the block if <condition> is met
                              and a previous if or else if condition was not already met
elseif, elsif, elif           Alternative spellings of else if

else                          Executes the contents of the block if no previous if or else if condition was already met

Suffixing a 'n' to if or else if inverts the sense of the condition.



Conditions:

Testing properties of the tweet being filtered:
tweet.<variable>              Tweet variable
retweet.<variable>            If this tweet is a retweet, test a property of the original tweet,
                              otherwise test the tweet as normal

Testing properties of user accounts associated with the tweet being filtered:
user.<variable>               Tweet author
retweetuser.<variable>        If this tweet is a retweet, test a property of the original tweet's author,
                              otherwise test the tweet's author as normal
userrecipient.<variable>      If this tweet is a DM, test a property of the DM's recipient,
                              otherwise test the tweet's author as normal

Tweet Condition Variables:

.flags <FLAGS>                Tests the current tweet's flags
                              where FLAGS is a set of zero or more flag letters, without intermediary whitespace
                              See tweetflags.txt for flag descriptions.
    +FLAGS                    At least one of FLAGS must be set (this is the default, if no symbol is used)
    =FLAGS                    All of FLAGS must be set
    -FLAGS                    None of FLAGS must be set
    /FLAGS                    At least one of FLAGS must be unset

The following condition variables accept a PCRE regular expression: regex, which is used to match a text value
.text <regex>                 Tweet text
.source <regex>               The tweet source string describes which app/client was used to post the tweet.
                              It is usually a HTML link.


User Condition Variables:

The following condition variables accept a PCRE regular expression: regex, which is used to match a text value
.name <regex>                 User's long name (not the @ screen name)
.screenname <regex>           User's screen name, excluding the @ symbol
.sname <regex>                Alternate spelling of .screenname
.description <regex>          User's description
.desc <regex>                 Alternate spelling of .description
.location <regex>             User's location
.loc <regex>                  Alternate spelling of .location


Actions:

set tweet.flags <FLAGS>       Sets or unsets one or more tweet flags
                              where FLAGS is a set of zero or more flag letters, without intermediary whitespace
                              See tweetflags.txt for flag descriptions.
    +FLAGS                    These FLAGS will be SET (this is the default, if no symbol is used)
    -FLAGS                    These FLAGS must be UNSET
                              Note that only some flags can be changed in this manner.
                              The flags which can currently be change include those in the set: Hur
